------

Sweepered is a simple clone of minesweeper in Java/JavaFX that I created as a learning project.

All the normal features of MineSweeper are here [Along with multiple modes], with some of my own personal design choices however.

Otherwise its mostly unimpressive, as it was simply a project to help me learn more about problem solving in Java.
